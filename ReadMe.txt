Pair Wars Java

Idea: Convert my Pair Wars program from C to Java, this time adding a GUI and using MVC design. Mainly for praticing my Java coding and learning some things along the way.

Progress. Currently the game runs, but doesn't display a winner or any information like that. I would like a log window as well, so that the player can see what happened.
It also needs to allow for the user to set the number of players. In addition to that I would like to have the user select the number of cards to be dealt out. Finally I would
like to beautify the windows so they don't look so ugly.  

Next Step: If possible, I would like to add additional games for the computer to play. That might become it's own project, but it's a start. I'm not sure I will add human
players just yet, but we shall see if that comes to fruition. The additonal games will be whatever I can come up with at the time. Not a solid plan, but leaves flexibility.
